      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of dynamic module loading and registration into detailed subtasks covering: 1) Module discovery mechanism design, 2) ComponentRegistry updates for dynamic registration, 3) Dependency resolution system, 4) Security verification framework, and 5) Error handling and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex architectural changes requiring deep system knowledge. It includes dynamic loading, dependency resolution, security considerations, and error handling. The existing 5 subtasks are well-structured, covering discovery, registration, dependency management, security, and documentation. The complexity comes from the need to maintain thread safety, handle circular dependencies, implement security measures, and ensure robust error recovery."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a persistent memory system using vector databases into detailed subtasks covering: 1) Embedding model selection and integration, 2) Vector database setup, 3) Memory schema design, 4) Storage implementation, 5) Retrieval logic, 6) KFMPlanner integration, 7) Testing strategy, and 8) Documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integrating vector databases with existing agent architecture. The current 8 subtasks are comprehensive, covering embedding models, database setup, schema design, storage/retrieval logic, integration, testing, and documentation. The complexity stems from designing appropriate schemas, implementing efficient vector search, and ensuring the retrieved memories meaningfully influence the agent's decision-making process."

      "taskTitle": "Enhance KFM Agent Transparency and Explainability based on Levels Framework",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhancement of KFM Agent transparency and explainability into detailed subtasks covering each level of the framework: 1) Level 2 - Observable semantic space variables and visualization, 2) Level 3 - Adaptation goal measurement and local explanations, 3) Level 4 - Global analytics and trend reporting, 4) Level 5 - Interactive explanatory interfaces, 5) Integration with existing infrastructure, and 6) User experience testing across technical and non-technical stakeholders.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its multi-layered approach to transparency and explainability. It requires implementing features across different abstraction levels, from basic variable observability to interactive explanatory dialogues. The task involves both technical implementation and user experience considerations. Currently, there are no subtasks defined, making it particularly challenging. The progressive nature of the framework means each level builds upon previous ones, requiring careful integration and testing."
