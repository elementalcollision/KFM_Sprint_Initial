# MVP Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

This document tracks the implementation and verification status of all MVP requirements for the KFM Agent project.

| Req ID      | Description | Implementation Status | Implementation Location(s) | Test Case(s) | Test Status | Gap Analysis / Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| MVP-REQ-001 | Agent must monitor simulated performance data (e.g., accuracy, latency) for 2-3 predefined components. | Implemented | `src.core.state_monitor.StateMonitor` (`get_performance_data`, `get_task_requirements`), `src.langgraph_nodes.kfm_decision_node` (consumes this data) | `tests.test_state_monitor.py` (`test_get_performance_data`, `test_get_task_requirements`, etc.), `src.core.validation.py` (MVP-REQ-001, REQ-003 blocks for `StateMonitor`) | Verified | `StateMonitor` unit tested. `validation.py` checks usage. Integration of this data into `kfm_decision_node` tested implicitly by E2E and `validation.py` REQ-001. |
| MVP-REQ-002 | Agent must apply simple, explicitly defined, rule-based KFM logic within the KFM Planner to decide 'Kill' (deactivate) or 'Marry' (activate) based on monitored data and simulated task requirements. | Implemented | `src.core.kfm_planner.KFMPlanner.decide_kfm_action()`, `src.langgraph_nodes.kfm_decision_node` (calls planner) | `tests.test_kfm_planner.py` (various scenarios), `src.core.validation.py` (MVP-REQ-001 block for `kfm_decision_node` & REQ-011 for `KFMPlanner` dynamic selection) | Verified | `KFMPlanner` logic extensively unit tested. Its use in `kfm_decision_node` is verified by `validation.py`. |
| MVP-REQ-003 | Agent must demonstrably change the 'active' status of components within the Component Registry based on KFM decisions from the Planner. | Implemented | `src.core.component_registry.ComponentRegistry.set_default_component()`, `src.core.execution_engine.ExecutionEngine.apply_kfm_action()` (calls registry), `src.langgraph_nodes.execute_action_node` (orchestrates) | `tests.test_execution_engine.py` (`test_apply_marry_action`, `test_apply_fuck_action`), `tests.test_component_registry.py` (needs update for method names but covers `set_default_component` intent via `set_active`), `src.core.validation.py` (MVP-REQ-002 for `execute_action_node` state change, MVP-REQ-005 for direct registry check) | Verified | Engine applying KFM action to change registry default is unit tested. Node behavior verified by `validation.py`. Test for `ComponentRegistry` needs method name update. |
| MVP-REQ-004 | Agent must execute a simple, predefined task (e.g., 'analyze_data') by calling the function associated with the currently active component for that task type, as determined by the Component Registry. | Implemented | `src.core.execution_engine.ExecutionEngine.execute_task()`, `src.core.component_registry.ComponentRegistry.get_default_component_key()` & `get_component()` | `tests.test_execution_engine.py` (`test_execute_task_success`, etc.), `src.core.validation.py` (MVP-REQ-006 block) | Verified | `ExecutionEngine.execute_task()` is well unit tested, including scenarios with no active component and component errors. `validation.py` also covers it. |
| MVP-REQ-005 | Agent must invoke a basic reflection step via an external LLM API call (Google AI Studio/Gemini) when a KFM action ('Kill' or 'Marry') has been successfully executed. | Implemented | `src.langgraph_nodes.reflection_node` (calls `LLMInteraction`), `src.core.llm_interaction.LLMInteraction.get_reflection()` | `tests.core.test_llm_interaction.py` (mocked API calls), `src.core.validation.py` (MVP-REQ-012, checks prompt generation), `tests.cli.test_kfm_verifier_e2e.py` (via `llm_api.log` check) | Partially Verified | Logic for LLM call is implemented and unit-tested with mocks. Prompt generation verified. E2E log check confirms call attempt. Live API call not part of automated tests. |
| MVP-REQ-006 | The reflection output (LLM commentary) must be logged but will NOT dynamically update the KFM rules within the MVP. | Implemented | `src.langgraph_nodes.reflection_node` (updates state with reflection), `src.core.llm_interaction.LLMInteraction` (generates reflection), Logging of LLM call via `llm_api.log`, `KFMPlanner` (hardcoded rules, not updated). | `tests.core.test_llm_interaction.py` (checks reflection content from mock), `tests.cli.test_kfm_verifier_e2e.py` (checks for `llm_api.log`), Manual review of `KFMPlanner` & `reflection_node`. | Partially Verified | Reflection content is logged to `llm_api.log`. No dynamic rule updates exist. State update with reflection is tested. Logging of the reflection from agent state to `kfm_agent.log` would need explicit log assertion. |
| MVP-REQ-007 | Implementation must use Python 3.x. | Implemented | Project `requirements.txt` (specifies Python version indirectly via dependencies), `venv/` structure, Python syntax used throughout. | Successful execution of all Python scripts and tests in a Python 3.11 environment. | Verified | Core language and environment. |
| MVP-REQ-008 | Development must utilize Cursor AI IDE features (e.g., code generation, debugging assistance) to meet the sprint timeline. | Implemented | Current development workflow, agent's interaction logs. | Self-attestation / Review of agent's contribution. | Verified | Process requirement, confirmed by agent usage. |
| MVP-REQ-009 | LLM access must be through Google AI Studio using a configured API Key for a Gemini model. | Implemented | `src.core.llm_interaction.LLMInteraction` (uses `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")`, uses Gemini model by default), `.env.example` (shows `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) | `tests.core.test_llm_interaction.py` (mocks API and env var). Note: `src.config.config_loader.py` does not directly load this key; `llm_interaction` gets it from env. | Partially Verified | Configuration path (env var `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) and model usage (Gemini default) are tested with mocks. Actual API key presence/validity is manual. `.env.example` provides guidance. |
| MVP-REQ-010 | The agent's control flow and state management must be implemented using the LangGraph framework. | Implemented | `src.kfm_agent.py` (`create_kfm_agent_graph`), `src.langgraph_nodes.py` (node definitions), `src.core.state.KFMAgentState` | `src.core.validation.py` (MVP-REQ-010 block checks graph structure), E2E test (`tests.cli.test_kfm_verifier_e2e.py` implicitly tests graph execution via CLI). | Verified | Core LangGraph framework usage (graph definition, state, nodes) is implemented. `validation.py` checks structural aspects. E2E flow relies on it. |
| MVP-REQ-011 | State changes, KFM decisions, component activations/deactivations, task execution attempts, and reflection outputs must be clearly logged. | Implemented | `src.core.logging_setup.py`, `src.logger.py`, Log statements in `src.langgraph_nodes` (e.g., `kfm_decision_node`, `execute_action_node`, `reflection_node`) and `src.core` modules (e.g. `KFMPlanner`, `ExecutionEngine`). Key logs: `kfm_agent.log`, `execution_engine.log`, `llm_api.log`. | `tests.core.test_logging_setup.py`; `src.core.validation.py` (MVP-REQ-009 block); E2E test (`tests.cli.test_kfm_verifier_e2e.py`) relies on mock log existence (e.g. `llm_api.log`, `kfm_agent.log`). | Partially Verified | Logging infrastructure and many log points exist and are unit-tested/ E2E-covered for presence. Specific content assertions for *all* listed events (state changes, KFM decisions, etc.) in their respective logs are not exhaustive. |
| MVP-REQ-012 | Basic error handling must be implemented in execution steps to prevent crashes and log errors to the state. | Implemented | `src.langgraph_nodes` (nodes update state on error), `src.core.exceptions.py`, `src.core.resilience.py`, `src.core.logging_setup.py` (error logging) | `tests.core.test_exceptions.py`, `tests.core.test_resilience.py`, `tests.test_execution_engine.py` (`test_execute_task_component_error`), `src.core.validation.py` (MVP-REQ-008 block for error handling in `execute_action_node`). | Partially Verified | Error handling mechanisms are implemented and unit-tested (custom exceptions, resilience decorator, specific node error paths). Error logging is part of logging setup. Comprehensive E2E error injection tests would provide fuller verification of state updates on all error types. |

## Summary

- **Overall Requirements Coverage:** 12 out of 12 requirements (100%) have their core functionality implemented.
- **Fully Implemented & Verified:** 
    - MVP-REQ-001 (Performance Monitoring Access)
    - MVP-REQ-002 (KFM Planner Logic)
    - MVP-REQ-003 (Registry Active Status Change - *Note: `tests.test_component_registry.py` needs method name updates*)
    - MVP-REQ-004 (Task Execution via Active Component)
    - MVP-REQ-007 (Python 3.x Usage)
    - MVP-REQ-008 (Cursor AI IDE Usage)
    - MVP-REQ-010 (LangGraph Framework Usage)
- **Requirements with Gaps/Issues (Partially Verified):**
    - **MVP-REQ-005 (LLM Reflection Call):** Logic implemented and unit-tested with mocks. Live API call not automated.
    - **MVP-REQ-006 (Reflection Logging - No Rule Update):** Reflection logged to `llm_api.log`; no dynamic rule updates exist. Logging of reflection from agent state to `kfm_agent.log` needs explicit assertion.
    - **MVP-REQ-009 (LLM Access Configuration):** Configuration path (env var) and model usage tested with mocks. API key validity is manual.
    - **MVP-REQ-011 (Comprehensive Logging):** Logging infrastructure and many points exist. Specific content assertions for all key events (state changes, KFM decisions, etc.) in their respective logs are not exhaustive.
    - **MVP-REQ-012 (Basic Error Handling):** Mechanisms implemented and unit-tested. Comprehensive E2E error injection tests for various failure types and state updates would improve verification.
- **Recommendations:**
    - Update `tests.test_component_registry.py` to use correct method names from `ComponentRegistry`.
    - Consider adding integration tests that mock the LLM API at a higher level to verify the reflection call sequence without live calls (if not already covered by E2E logging check).
    - Enhance logging tests: Add specific assertions for the content of critical log messages related to state changes, KFM decisions, and reflection output in `kfm_agent.log`.
    - Expand E2E testing to include more diverse error injection scenarios to robustly verify error handling and state reporting.
    - Perform a manual check of `.env` configuration for `GOOGLE_API_KEY` if live LLM testing is planned outside automated suite.
