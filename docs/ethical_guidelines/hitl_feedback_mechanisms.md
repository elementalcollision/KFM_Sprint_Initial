# KFM Agent HITL Feedback Mechanisms for Continuous Improvement

## 1. Introduction

This document details the feedback mechanisms designed to capture insights from Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) reviews of the Kill-Fuck-Marry (KFM) autonomous agent. The primary goal of these mechanisms is to create a structured process for learning from human expertise, continuously improving the agent\'s performance, refining its ethical alignment, and enhancing the HITL process itself.

This document complements the `docs/ethical_guidelines/hitl_workflows.md` and the `docs/training/hitl_reviewer_training_program.md`.

## 2. Goals of the Feedback System

*   **Improve Agent Accuracy:** Reduce the frequency of incorrect or suboptimal agent proposals.
*   **Enhance Agent Reasoning:** Make the agent\'s decision-making process more robust and understandable.
*   **Refine Ethical Safeguards:** Ensure the agent operates consistently within defined ethical boundaries and identify new ethical considerations.
*   **Optimize HITL Process:** Make HITL reviews more efficient and effective for human reviewers.
*   **Strengthen Trust:** Build confidence in the agent\'s autonomous capabilities through transparent learning and adaptation.

## 3. Types of Feedback to Capture

During each HITL review, the system should aim to capture the following types of feedback from the human reviewer:

### 3.1. Core Decision Feedback
*   **Human Decision:** The action taken by the human reviewer (Approve, Override, Reject/Veto, Defer).
*   **If Overridden:** The specific alternative action chosen by the human.
*   **Confidence in Human Decision:** (Optional) Reviewer\'s confidence level in their own decision.

### 3.2. Rationale & Justification
*   **Structured Reason Codes (for Override/Reject/Veto):** A predefined list of reasons for deviating from the agent\'s proposal. Examples:
    *   `DATA_INTERPRETATION_ERROR`: Agent misinterpreted performance metrics or input data.
    *   `MISSING_CONTEXT_AGENT`: Agent lacked crucial contextual information not available in its current data.
    *   `ETHICAL_CONCERN_UNFLAGGED`: Reviewer identified an ethical issue not flagged by the agent/ECM.
    *   `STRATEGIC_ALIGNMENT_ISSUE`: Agent\'s proposal conflicts with broader strategic goals.
    *   `RISK_ASSESSMENT_INCORRECT`: Agent underestimated or misjudged potential risks.
    *   `ALTERNATIVE_SOLUTION_BETTER`: A more optimal solution existed that the agent did not consider.
    *   `POLICY_VIOLATION_AGENT`: Agent\'s proposal would violate an established policy or guideline.
*   **Detailed Rationale (Free-text):** Mandatory for Override, Reject/Veto decisions. A clear explanation of why the human reviewer made their decision, referencing specific data points or principles.

### 3.3. Agent Performance Assessment
*   **Agent Reasoning Clarity:** (e.g., Rating scale 1-5) How clear and understandable was the agent\'s provided reasoning?
*   **Review Package Quality:** (e.g., Rating scale 1-5) Was the information provided in the Review Package complete, accurate, and sufficient for making a decision?
*   **Missing Information:** (Optional Free-text or Checklist) Specific data points or context the reviewer felt was missing from the agent\'s package.

### 3.4. HITL Process & Trigger Feedback
*   **Intervention Value:** (e.g., Rating scale 1-5 or Yes/No) Was this specific HITL intervention valuable/necessary?
*   **Trigger Appropriateness:** (Optional Free-text) Comments on whether the trigger for this HITL event was too sensitive, not sensitive enough, or just right.

### 3.5. Ethical & Safety Observations
*   **Unflagged Ethical Concerns:** (Checkbox/Free-text) Did the reviewer identify any ethical concerns not explicitly flagged by the agent or the Ethical Configuration Manager (ECM)? Describe.
*   **Potential Safety Issues:** (Checkbox/Free-text) Did the reviewer identify any potential safety issues related to the agent\'s proposal or current state?

### 3.6. Suggestions for System Improvement
*   **General Comments/Suggestions:** (Optional Free-text) Broader suggestions for improving the KFM agent, its data sources, the HITL workflow, or documentation.

## 4. Methods for Collecting Feedback

Feedback will be collected through a combination of integrated tools and periodic processes:

### 4.1. Integrated HITL Review Interface
*   **Primary Collection Point:** The dashboard, CLI, or other interface used by human reviewers to manage HITL events.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Structured Inputs:** Dropdown menus, radio buttons, and checkboxes for selecting human decisions, reason codes, and ratings.
    *   **Mandatory Rationale Fields:** Free-text boxes for detailed justifications, especially for overrides and vetoes.
    *   **Contextual Prompts:** Guidance to reviewers on the type of feedback being sought at each step.
    *   **Automated Logging:** All feedback submitted through the interface will be automatically timestamped and logged alongside the corresponding HITL event data.

### 4.2. Periodic Reviewer Surveys
*   **Purpose:** To gather more in-depth qualitative feedback on the overall HITL process, reviewer workload, training effectiveness, and identify systemic issues or trends not captured in individual event feedback.
*   **Frequency:** e.g., Quarterly or bi-annually.
*   **Format:** Anonymous online surveys with a mix of rating scales and open-ended questions.

### 4.3. Reviewer Community of Practice / Feedback Forums
*   **Purpose:** To provide an ongoing channel for reviewers to discuss challenging cases, share insights, ask questions, and collaboratively identify areas for improvement.
*   **Platform:** Dedicated channels (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams), internal wikis, or regular meetings (as outlined in the Training Program).
*   **Moderation:** Facilitated by members of the AI Ethics and Governance Council or KFM operations team to ensure discussions are productive and actionable insights are captured.

### 4.4. Direct Interviews & Workshops
*   **Purpose:** To conduct deep dives into specific complex HITL events or to explore systemic issues identified through other feedback channels.
*   **Frequency:** As needed, or on a scheduled basis (e.g., semi-annually).
*   **Participants:** Key reviewers, KFM developers, ethicists, and operations personnel.

## 5. Storage and Management of Feedback

*   **Centralized Repository:** All collected feedback (structured data from interfaces, survey results, summarized discussion points, interview notes) will be stored in a centralized, secure repository.
*   **Linkage to HITL Events:** Feedback should be clearly linked to the specific HITL event ID it pertains to, allowing for contextual analysis.
*   **Data Schema:** A defined schema for storing feedback data to ensure consistency and facilitate analysis.
*   **Access Control:** Appropriate access controls to ensure data privacy and integrity.

## 6. Utilization of Feedback for Continuous Improvement

Collected feedback is crucial for a multi-faceted improvement loop:

### 6.1. Agent Learning & Adaptation (Longer-Term)
*   **Curated Datasets for Fine-Tuning:** Human-verified decisions (especially overrides with clear rationale) can form a dataset for fine-tuning the KFM planner LLM or other predictive models within the agent.
*   **Knowledge Base Augmentation:** Insights, corrected facts, or new contextual information derived from feedback can be structured and added to the agent\'s knowledge base (e.g., vector database like ChromaDB) to improve future reasoning.
*   **Bias Detection & Mitigation:** Feedback on perceived bias in agent proposals can trigger investigations and lead to adjustments in data preprocessing, model architecture, or output filtering.

### 6.2. HITL System & Process Refinement (Medium-Term)
*   **Trigger Adjustment:** Feedback on intervention value and trigger appropriateness will inform adjustments to HITL trigger thresholds and criteria in `hitl_workflows.md`.
*   **Review Package Enhancement:** Feedback on missing information or clarity will be used to improve the content and presentation of the agent-generated Review Package.
*   **Ethical Ontology Evolution:** Identified ethical concerns or suggestions can lead to updates in the `EthicalConfigManager` parameters or the underlying ethical ontologies.

### 6.3. Reviewer Training & Support Improvement (Short-Term)
*   **Training Program Updates:** Patterns in reviewer decisions or feedback indicating misunderstanding of concepts will lead to updates in the `docs/training/hitl_reviewer_training_program.md` and retraining sessions.
*   **Guideline Clarification:** Ambiguities or gaps identified in existing guidelines (`hitl_workflows.md`, ethics policies) will be addressed with revisions and clarifications.
*   **Tool Enhancement:** Feedback on the usability of review interfaces will drive improvements to these tools.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities for Feedback Management

*   **Human Reviewers:** Responsible for providing timely, honest, and constructive feedback.
*   **KFM Agent Development Team:** Responsible for implementing technical changes to the agent, its models, and HITL interfaces based on feedback.
*   **AI Ethics and Governance Council (or equivalent body):** Responsible for overseeing the feedback process, analyzing systemic ethical issues, guiding updates to ethical ontologies and guidelines, and ensuring the feedback loop is effective.
*   **Operations Team:** Responsible for monitoring the HITL process, managing the feedback repository, and facilitating communication between reviewers and development/ethics teams.

## 8. Review and Update of Feedback Mechanisms

These feedback mechanisms will be reviewed periodically (e.g., annually) by the AI Ethics and Governance Council and relevant stakeholders to ensure their continued effectiveness and relevance.
