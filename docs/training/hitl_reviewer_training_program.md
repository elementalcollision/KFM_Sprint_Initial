## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the training program for designated human reviewers responsible for overseeing the Kill-Fuck-Marry (KFM) autonomous agent via the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow. The goal of this program is to equip reviewers with the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools to make informed decisions, ensuring the KFM agent operates safely, ethically, and effectively.

## 2. Target Audience

This training program is designed for personnel involved in the oversight of the KFM agent, including but not limited to:

*   Senior Engineers
*   System Architects
*   Operations Leads
*   Members of the AI Ethics and Governance Council
*   Product Managers overseeing KFM-managed systems

## 3. Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this training program, participants will be able to:

*   **Understand Core Concepts:** Clearly articulate the KFM agent\'s purpose, its core actions (Kill, Fuck, Marry, No Action), and the fundamentals of its decision-making process.
*   **Grasp Ethical Implications:** Explain the importance of HITL, identify key ethical considerations relevant to the KFM agent, and understand the established ethical guidelines and operational boundaries.
*   **Master HITL Workflows:** Confidently navigate the end-to-end HITL workflow, from trigger identification to final decision logging, as defined in `docs/ethical_guidelines/hitl_workflows.md`.
