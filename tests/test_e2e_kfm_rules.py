End-to-End Tests for KFM Rule Conditions

This module contains comprehensive end-to-end tests for the KFM (Kill, Marry, No Action)
rule conditions. The tests verify that the KFM agent correctly applies decision rules
based on component performance metrics.

The test suite is structured as follows:

1. KFMRuleTestSuite (Base Class)
   - Provides common utilities for all KFM rule tests
   - Extends CompiledGraphTestHarness for compiled graph testing capabilities
   - Includes methods for configuring different test scenarios and verifying results

2. TestKillActionScenarios
   - Tests verification of "Kill" action for underperforming components
   - Includes standard, boundary, and edge cases

3. TestMarryActionScenarios
   - Tests verification of "Marry" action for exceptional components
   - Includes scenarios with multiple candidates and historical performance

4. TestNoActionScenarios
   - Tests verification of "No Action" decisions
   - Includes mixed signals, below threshold, and gradually changing metrics scenarios

Each test case includes:
- Clear documentation of what is being tested and why
- Configuration of specific test scenarios
- Verification of expected KFM actions
- Validation of log patterns and state transitions
- Testing of reflection capabilities

Run these tests using the provided script:
python scripts/run_kfm_rule_tests.py

For detailed documentation on the test suite and test cases, see:
docs/testing/kfm_rule_tests.md

            ### Decision Context
            - Task: marry_historical_test
            - Chosen Component: analyze_accurate
            - Action: Marry
            - Historical Data: Available for last 5 executions
            
            ### Historical Performance Analysis
            Looking at the historical performance:
            - Component has shown consistent accuracy improvement (0.82 → 0.88 → 0.91)
            - Latency has remained stable (1.2s → 1.1s → 1.2s)
            - No significant regressions observed
            
            ### Justification
            The marry decision is well-supported by both current metrics and historical trends.
            The component shows a positive trajectory in accuracy while maintaining acceptable
            latency characteristics.
            
            ### Risk Assessment
            Low risk of regressing based on the historical stability observed.
            
            ### Recommendation
            Continue using this component as the preferred option for this task type.
            Consider lowering the monitoring frequency for this component given its stability.

            The current component is performing within expected parameters. No Kill or Marry action is necessary at this time.

            Continue monitoring performance metrics for any significant changes that might require intervention in the future.
